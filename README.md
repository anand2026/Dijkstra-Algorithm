# Dijkstra-Algorithm

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++ with reading a map from a file.

## Description

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes.

## Features

- Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++
- Map reading from file
- Shortest path calculation
- Visual representation of the path
